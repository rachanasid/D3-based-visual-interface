# D3-based-visual-interface

The project contains a Python script app.py, HTML file index.html, CSS file style.css and JavaScript file script.js. Data clustering and dimension reduction are implemented on UK road accident data set. The chosen data set contains 250k rows and 70 features/columns. The data is cleaned by filling the missing values using various data cleaning techniques. Columns with more than 70% of Nan values are removed. Some date entries which are not in the mm/dd/yyyy format are handled accordingly. The data is standardized. K-means is used to cluster the data and Stratified sampling is used to reduce the number of rows to 40%. PCA is implemented to reduce the number of columns to 40. DataFrames is used to store the big data. Using D3.js, the final data obtained after sampling and performing PCA analysis, is displayed. Correlation Matrix, Scatter Plot Matrix, Interactive Dashboard, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Grouped Bar Chart, TreeMap, Stacked Bar Chart are used to analyze the data.
